# TYRON Fungible Token
TYRON is the Fungible Token operated by the TYRON dApp Community, which manages its liquidity to ensure its decentralized exchange. These are used to join the "The TYRON Governing & Profit-Sharing Community", but without entitling the holder of TYRON to receive payments of any kind from any person (meaning that is not a security). 

But if you want to buy NFT Usernames and access DeFi applications on the TYRON Network, it is possible to transmute TYRON into our stablecoin, Self-Sovereign Identity Dollars ($SI). 

## Self-Sovereign Identity Dollar

The Self-Sovereign Identity Dollar ($SI) is an algorithmic stablecoin. Its [implementation](./$si.tyron.scilla) smart contract is made for ... 

```graphql
1.0 $SI = 1.0 zUSDT

or

1.0 $SI = 1.33 XSGD
```

The $SI can only come into existence through the transmutation of TYRON, which decreases the token supply. Whenever $SI is minted, TYRON with the same amount of value is burned.

The exchange rate to transmute TYRON into $SI gets read in real-time from the TYRON/$SI liquidity pair in the TYRON Community dApp (Governing & Profit-Sharing Community).

Rewards to the TYRON Community DApp get distributed to its participants by depositing them into the TYRON and $SI liquidity pools. Community participants can accrue their earnings by removing liquidity.
