# Profit-Sharing Tokens

A Profit-Sharing Token (PST) enables token holders to become shareholders of the organization behind the PST, which provides products and services to users. It is a new kind of cryptocurrency that - besides giving token holders the monetary value of the fungible token - also provides governance rights and, more importantly, a passive income by distributing the organization's profits among token holders. Such a distribution is coded into the PST smart contract based on the share of each token holder, meaning that if you own 10% of the PST supply, you will get 10% of the profits in every cycle (be it monthly, quarterly, yearly, among others).

The organization behind a PST enacts a Profit-Sharing Community (PSC), and its governance should aim at being decentralized. For that purpose, the PST has a voting mechanism when distributing the profits: the smart contract collects the vote of each token holder and ponderates their votes according to their shares, which means that if you own 10% of the PST supply, you will have 10% of the voting decision. Through decentralized governance, the PSC decides what the quorum is and how much the fees are. Fees can get collected depending on the products and services provided by the organization.
