Welcome to the TYRON open-source smart contracts, which are the core of the [Self-Sovereign Identity Protocol](https://tyron.network/ssiprotocol). They are in active development, and you can find them in their corresponding folders:

# tyronZIL

[tyronZIL](./DID/tyronZIL.scilla) is the TYRON Decentralized Identifier (DID), which implements the [tyronZIL W3C DID Method](https://tyronzil.com).

# xWALLETS

xWallets are decentralized applications that integrate the tyronZIL DID method.

- [DIDx](./DID/dApps/xWallets/DIDxWallet/v6/DIDxWALLET_v6.1.scilla): W3C Decentralized Identifier Smart Contract Wallet

- [ZILx](./DID/dApps/xWallets/ZILxWallet/ZILxWallet.scilla): $ZIL staking xWallet

- [SBTx](./DID/dApps/xWallets/SBTxWallet/SBTxWallet.scilla): Soulbound tokens xWallet

# Fungible tokens:

- [TYRON](./FUNGIBLE_TOKENS/TYRON/README.md)
- [$SI](./FUNGIBLE_TOKENS/$SI/README.md)
- [Profit-sharing token](./PST/README.md) 

# Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)
- [TYRON DNS](./NON_FUNGIBLE_TOKENS/TYRON_ZRC6.scilla): TYRON Domain Name System that integrates the Zilliqa-Reference-Contract #6 standard

# INIT

The [INIT DApp](./DID/dApps/Init/v3/INITDApp_v3.6.scilla) is the SSI Initialization & Domain Name System decentralized application. It manages the .ssi & .did NFT domain names. All profits are managed by the Governing & Profit-Sharing Community DApp.

# DAO

Besides the self-sovereign identities (SSIs), the Tyron Decentralized Autonomous Organisation has developed the [xPoints DApp](xPOINTS/xpoints.tyron.scilla).
