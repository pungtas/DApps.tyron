Welcome to the TYRON decentralised applications made of open-source smart contracts that build the [Self-Sovereign Identity Protocol](https://tyron.network/ssiprotocol). They are in active development, and you can find them in their corresponding sections:

# tyronZIL

[tyronZIL](./DID) is the W3C Decentralized Identifier (DID) dApp, which implements the [tyronZIL W3C DID Method](https://tyronzil.com).

# xWALLET dApps

An xWALLET is a decentralised application that integrates the tyronZIL DID method. Thus they all come with Social Recovery from the get-go.

- [DIDx](./DID/dApps/xWallets/DIDxWallet): This is the main digital wallet of your SSI account. Its open-source code goes by the name W3C Decentralized Identifier Smart Contract Wallet.

- [DEFIx](./DID/dApps/xWallets/DEFIxWallet/README.md): Decentralised Finance Smart Contract Wallet.

- [SBTx](./DID/dApps/xWallets/SBTxWallet): The Soulbound tokens wallet of your SSI account.

# Fungible tokens:

- [$TYRON](./FUNGIBLE_TOKENS/TYRON)
- [S$I](./FUNGIBLE_TOKENS/SSIDOLLAR)
- [Profit-sharing token](./PST) 

# Non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

All the following decentralised applications expand the Zilliqa-Reference-Contract #6 standard.

- [SSI DNS](./NON_FUNGIBLE_TOKENS/SSIDNS): The Self-Sovereign Identity Domain Name System is growing with the .gzil NFT domain names.

- [lexica.ssi](./LEXICA_SSI): These free NFTs are helpful to personalise your SSI account by using text-to-image AI provided & hosted by [lexica.art](https://lexica.art).

# SSI INIT

The [SSI INIT](./DID/dApps/Init) dapp is the Self-Sovereign Identity Initialization & Domain Name System decentralised application. It manages the .ssi & .did NFT domain names. All profits are managed by the Governing & Profit-Sharing Community with the community.ssi account.

# DAO

Besides self-sovereign identity (SSI) accounts, the Tyron Decentralised Autonomous Organisation has developed the [xPoints](DAO/xpoints.tyron.scilla) & [Donate](DAO/donate.tyron.scilla) dApp.
